<h1>MODULE 3 - WEB API'S</h1>

<p>This is my web API project for Module 3</p>
<p>I followed a tutorial from Traversy Media. It was super informative and fun to do.</p>
<br>
<p>I commented over everything in the JS file but felt that it was not necessary <br>in the HTML and the CSS because its so small and easy to understand.</p>
<p>For most of the styling I used Bootstrap and the Icon comes from Font Awesome.</p>
