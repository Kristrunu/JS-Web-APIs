<h1>MODULE 3 - WEB API'S</h1>

<h3>My Book List</h3>

<p>This is my web API project for Module 3 <br>I followed a tutorial from Traversy Media. It was super informative and fun to do.</p>
<p>In this simple booklist app you can add your books and the list will be stored in local storage so it won't disappear when you exit the browser. It plays error message if you don't fill all the boxes and a success message when you add or delete a book.</p>
<p>I commented over everything in the JS file but felt that it was not necessary <br>in the HTML and the CSS because its so small and easy to understand. <br>For most of the styling I used Bootstrap and the Icon comes from Font Awesome.</p>
